## About the project

![Game Preview](https://github.com/FaizanAsifB/Portfolio/blob/main/src/content/projects/project-images/name-place-wide.jpg?raw=true)

Name Place Animal Thing is a digitally adapted multiplayer game inspired by the classical game of the same name. The game is designed to engage users in a fun and competitive gaming experience. Players participate in rounds where a random alphabet is chosen, and they must provide answers for various categories starting with that letter.

The development of this project marked my first solo venture into web development. I navigated all aspects from conceptualization to implementation, overcoming challenges and innovating within the realm of web development.

One of the primary goals was to implement real-time multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete dynamically irrespective of their geographical locations. The game offers two gameplay modes to cater to different preferences: in Mode 1, rounds conclude when the timer reaches zero, while in Mode 2, the timer resets to 10 seconds upon the first playerâ€™s submission of answers, ensuring fast-paced gameplay. Points are awarded based on answer uniqueness, encouraging creativity and strategic thinking among players. Multiple rounds ensure continuous gameplay and opportunities for players to improve their scores.

Implementing real-time functionality posed significant challenges, requiring the integration of Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore to ensure seamless gameplay synchronization across devices. Fine-tuning game mechanics and scoring systems was essential for maintaining a fair and enjoyable experience while promoting engagement and competitiveness. Cross-platform compatibility was ensured through responsive design principles, adapting the game for optimal performance on desktops, smartphones, and tablets. The user experience was a key focus, achieved through iterative prototyping and usability testing to refine navigation and enhance player interaction.
